    "> A positive displacement (PD) flow meter is a type of flow meter that provides high accuracy (Â±0.1% of actual flow rate in some cases) and good repeatability (as high as 0.05% of reading)...\n",
    "> They are ideal for flow measurement of viscous fluids, such as oils, fuels, and solvents that are difficult for other types of flow meters to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> While PD flow meters are very robust, there are limitations to their usage. Firstly, they should not be used for fluids that contain large particles, unless these can be filtered out prior to the fluid entering the measuring chamber.\n",
    "> They are also not suitable for applications where large pockets of air are present within the fluid; however, air eliminators are available for these applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Another factor that requires consideration is the pressure drop caused by the PD flow meter; although these are minimal, they should also be allowed for in system calculations.\n",

    "> Positive displacement flowmeters are very accurate and have high turndown.\n",
    "> They can be used in very viscous, dirty and corrosive fluids and essentially require no straight runs of pipe for fluid flow stream conditioning though pressure drop can be an issue.\n",

    "<href> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_displacement_meter#Advantages_and_considerations</href>\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that there are not large particles (and presumably no large pockets of air either), we assume PD are valid over most ranges. It should be noted, however that there pressure drop across the positive-displacement meter should be taken into consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Turbine meters should be sized so that the expected average flow is between 60% and 75% of the maximum capacity of the meter.\n",
    "> Flow velocities under 1 ft/sec can be insufficient, while velocities in excess of 10 ft/sec can result in excessive wear.\n",
    "> Most turbine meters are designed for maximum velocities of 30 ft/sec.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Viscosity affects the accuracy and linearity of turbine meters. It is therefore important to calibrate the meter for the specific fluid it is intended to measure.\n",
    "> Repeatability is generally not greatly affected by changes in viscosity, and turbine meters often are used to control the flow of viscous fluids.\n",
    "> Generally, turbine meters perform well if the Reynolds Number is greater than 4,000 and less than or equal to 20,000.\n",

    "Since we are assuming our water is not very viscous, the only limitations appear during low flowrates. At low flow velocities, the rotational speed of the rotor decreases, and accurate measurement becomes challenging due to reduced rotor inertia and potential sensitivity to external factors like bearing friction."
